    "### Basic Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some basic arithmetic operators and examples of how they can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition (+):** Combining two values to find their sum. Example: 5 + 3 = 8.\n",
    "- **Subtraction (-):** Finding the difference between two values. Example: 10 - 7 = 3.\n",
    "- **Multiplication (*):** Multiplying two values to get the product. Example: 4 * 6 = 24.\n",
    "- **Division (/):** Dividing one value by another to get the quotient. Example: 15 / 3 = 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order of Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions often involve multiple operations. The order in which these operations are performed follows the standard \"PEMDAS\" rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parentheses:** Operations inside parentheses are performed first.\n",
    "2. **Exponents:** Calculations involving exponents are done next.\n",
    "3. **Multiplication and Division:** These operations are performed from left to right.\n",
    "4. **Addition and Subtraction:** Similarly, these operations are performed from left to right.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Additional Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some more complex examples to illustrate how arithmetic expressions work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expression 1:** (7 + 2) * 3 = 27\n",
    "- **Expression 2:** 10 / (2 + 3) = 2\n",
    "- **Expression 3:** 2 ** 4 + 1 = 17 (Note: ** represents exponentiation)\n",
    "\n",
